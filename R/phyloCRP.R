#' phyloCRP: Modelling phylogenetic subtrees with a Chinese Restaurant Process.
#'
#' This is the implementation of a method to fit a phylogenetic subtrees model.
#' The main idea is set up a statistical model that describes a collection of
#' phylogenetic subtrees in order to take into account 1) the uncertainty of the
#' input data and 2) the data incompleteness assumption.
